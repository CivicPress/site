# Current Session Log

- **Date:** 2025-11-10
- **Focus:** Scaffold Nuxt UI project, configure i18n/SEO modules, and document workflow priorities.
- **Notes:** Template content remains placeholder; domain now targets civicpress.io (legacy civic-press.org redirects). SEO modules removed temporarily due to nuxt-site-config runtime errors.
- **Open Questions:** Confirm branding assets, copywriting sources, localization ownership, and deployment workflow expectations.

_Update this file during active collaboration and summarize outcomes in `agent/memory/` afterward._
