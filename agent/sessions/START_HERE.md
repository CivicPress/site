# Start Here

Welcome to the CivicPress landing project. Follow these steps before contributing:

1. Read `.cursor/rules.md` for workspace-wide expectations.
2. Review `agent/context/priorities.md` and `agent/context/blockers.md`.
3. Skim `agent/memory/project-state.md` and `agent/memory/decisions.md` to understand history.
4. If you start a new session, log key activities in `current-session.md` and move notes to memory afterward.
5. Update any affected documents once your work concludes.

Need help? Ping the project maintainer or leave questions in `current-session.md`.
