# Quick Guide

## Daily Workflow
1. Check `agent/context/priorities.md` and clarify scope with stakeholders if unclear.
2. Draft a **Plan** before coding; align with `.cursor/rules.md`.
3. Implement changes in Nuxt files; prefer extending Nuxt UI components.
4. Document updates in `agent/memory/project-state.md` and log decisions as needed.
5. Prepare deployment notes when adjustments affect GitHub Pages automation.
