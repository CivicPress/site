# CivicPress Agent Workspace

This directory gives automated assistants and contributors the smallest set of guardrails needed to work on the CivicPress landing page.

## Structure
- `conventions.md` — shared coding/content conventions.
- `context/` — active priorities, blockers, and reference links.
- `memory/` — lightweight project history and decisions.
- `sessions/` — onboarding entry point and session summaries.
- `tools/` — quick guides and checklists that keep workflows consistent.

## Usage
1. Read `sessions/START_HERE.md` at the start of any new collaboration.
2. Update `context/priorities.md` and `memory/project-state.md` as plans evolve.
3. Capture noteworthy choices in `memory/decisions.md`; keep entries concise and dated.
4. Extend guides instead of duplicating instructions elsewhere; cross-link to the main README when needed.
