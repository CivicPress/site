# CivicPress Manifesto

_Manifesto v1.0 – June 2025_

The CivicPress Manifesto is a declaration of intent. It outlines why this project exists, what it stands for, and how it intends to serve cities, citizens, and the public interest through open civic infrastructure. This document is for local administrators, developers, civic workers, designers, journalists, and all those who believe technology should serve democracy — not the other way around.

## 1. Why CivicPress Now?

Digital infrastructure has become essential to democratic life — as vital as roads, water, and public records. But while democracy demands **transparency, participation, and accountability**, most of the software used to govern our communities is built without any of those values in mind.

Across the world, public institutions are forced to rely on expensive, closed, and fragile systems. When these systems fail — as they so often do — the damage is not only technical or financial. It erodes trust. It slows down services. It disconnects people from decisions made in their name.

And worst of all, it wastes public time, public money, and public dignity.

Small towns and local governments are often left behind entirely. Their records live in folders and PDFs. Their decisions go unarchived. Their citizens are expected to participate without clear access to the facts.

**CivicPress is born from this crisis.**  
Not as a product, but as a public infrastructure project — a refusal to accept that modern governance must be expensive, obscure, or inefficient.  
It is a response to a global pattern:  
Public money spent on private systems that complicate rather than clarify.  
Citizens expected to trust systems they cannot inspect.  
Administrators expected to govern without the tools they deserve.

We believe digital systems must be **transparent**, **efficient**, and **public-serving by default**.

We believe in a democracy that works in daylight.  
Where every vote, every budget, every service request has a visible, verifiable path.  
Where tools are open to inspection, built for use, and scaled to fit every town — not just the wealthy few.

CivicPress is designed to make that possible.  
It is open-source, modular, and resilient.  
It can run locally or in the cloud. It can survive outages. It can explain itself.  
And above all, it exists to **restore trust in governance by making its workings clear, efficient, and worthy of the people it serves**.

_CivicPress is not anti-vendor. It’s pro-transparency._

If legacy players want to support these principles, even better — they have the reach. Let’s give them the reason.

### ⚖️ A Pattern of Failure, Globally

Public-sector digital infrastructure has failed communities around the world. These failures are not isolated — they are systemic. Here are just a few examples:

- **Canada – Phénix (2016–ongoing):** IBM; a $2.4B payroll disaster affecting over 100,000 federal employees. [Source](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/phoenix-pay-system-2020-1.5461545)
- **United States – VA EHR Modernization:** Oracle Cerner; a multibillion-dollar health records project for veterans that remains unusable. [Source](https://www.fedscoop.com/va-ehr-modernization-cost/)
- **United Kingdom – NHS NPfIT:** £10B spent on an electronic health record system that was cancelled before completion. [Source](https://www.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/10121056.pdf)
- **France – Louvois:** Military payroll system error led to €1B in mispayments. [Source](https://www.france24.com/en/20140204-france-military-pay-system-louvois-failure)
- **Australia – Robodebt:** An unlawful automated welfare debt program that harmed hundreds of thousands. [Source](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jul/06/robodebt-class-action-settled-government-to-refund-470000-people)
- **India – Aadhaar Welfare Integration:** Biometric errors in welfare delivery have excluded millions. [Source](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/03/technology/india-id-aadhaar.html)
- **Germany – Toll Collect:** Truck toll software delays cost over €6.5B in lost revenue. [Source](https://www.dw.com/en/germanys-toll-collect-fiasco-costly/a-1416466)
- **South Africa – e-Tolls:** A toll collection system undermined by public resistance and financial loss. [Source](https://businesstech.co.za/news/government/547384/government-finally-makes-a-decision-on-e-tolls-in-south-africa/)

## 2. The Broken Status Quo

Governments today do not build their own tools.  
They buy them — prepackaged, proprietary, and purposefully complex.

The companies that supply these systems are not accountable to the public. They are accountable to shareholders. Their incentives are misaligned from the start: to bill hours, to protect source code, to create dependency — not transparency.

And when their products fail, it is not Oracle or CGI that suffers.  
It is the clerk who can’t process a permit.  
It is the mayor who can’t publish a budget.  
It is the citizen who stops showing up — because nothing changes.

Local governments are especially vulnerable.  
Most lack in-house developers.  
Most can’t afford consultants.  
They rely on spreadsheets, PDFs, and brittle systems inherited from another era — or imposed by another level of government.

When something breaks, they’re told:  
> “Submit a ticket.”  
> “Wait for version 6.”  
> “Buy the upgrade.”  
> “That’s not supported anymore.”

This is not digital democracy.  
This is vendor lock-in with public money.

And even the most basic democratic processes — **council sessions, committee meetings, public hearings** — are often out of reach.  
They happen behind closed doors, or in inaccessible formats.  
Agendas are unclear. Recordings go missing. Minutes are posted months late, if at all.

Citizens who want to follow decisions must dig through scattered websites, download outdated files, or physically attend weekday meetings that aren’t recorded or streamed.

This isn’t just a tech problem.  
It’s a trust problem.  
A transparency problem.  
A civic fracture that grows with every missing document, broken link, or unanswered question.

And it will not be solved by the same firms that profit from the opacity.

## 3. What We’re Building

CivicPress is not a single product.
It’s a modular, open-source civic platform — like WordPress for local governance, or Odoo for public institutions.

At its core, CivicPress is an **open-source ERP for local governments**.  
It’s modular, composable, and built to serve communities of any size — from a village of 500 to a national agency serving millions.

It’s not locked behind licenses. It’s not “software as a service.”  
_It’s a civic platform — designed to serve communities, not corporations._

CivicPress is a modular, open-source platform designed to help local governments run transparently, accountably, and efficiently — online or offline.

---

### 3.1 Modular by Design

Every town has different needs.  
Some need a meeting archive. Others need permit tracking, budget transparency, or public consultations.  

CivicPress is built as a set of modules — not a monolith.  
Governments can start small and grow gradually.  

Install what’s needed, ignore what’s not, and shape the system around real civic workflows — not vendor roadmaps.

---

### 3.2 Built for Resilience

CivicPress is designed to run:
- In the cloud or on a local server  
- With or without internet access  
- In well-funded cities or rural municipalities  
- In stable conditions or emergency response zones

No fragile login systems. No mandatory internet connection.  
A town hall with a laptop and a USB key can run CivicPress, export its records, and remain functional in a storm, a blackout, or a service outage.

Public infrastructure must survive adversity — and so should its digital foundation.

---

### 3.3 Markdown as Civic Format

CivicPress stores public records — motions, minutes, decisions, drafts — in **plain Markdown**.

Why Markdown?

- It’s readable by humans  
- Editable with any basic text tool  
- Easy to version, track, and publish  
- Friendly to both non-technical staff and developers  
- Resistant to obsolescence

Council minutes don’t need to be locked in PDFs.  
Budgets don’t need to be buried in spreadsheets.  
Every record can live in a clean, open format — one that a citizen, a journalist, or a future clerk can open and understand.

Transparency isn’t a feature — it’s a format.

---

### 3.4 Public by Default

CivicPress is designed for both staff and citizens.  
It doesn’t just help manage civic work — it helps **share it**.

- Meetings can be livestreamed and archived  
- Minutes are published in real time  
- Budgets, laws, and plans become linkable, legible, and verifiable  
- Participation becomes possible — not just symbolic

Just as WordPress democratized publishing,  
CivicPress aims to **democratize local governance infrastructure** — one transparent, accessible record at a time.

Because the work of government belongs to the people.  
And the systems behind it should too.

## 4. Our Core Principles

CivicPress is built on a foundation of values — not just features.  
These principles guide how we design, develop, and deliver the platform.  
They remind us that civic technology is never truly neutral — because every design shapes access, visibility, and power.

CivicPress is guided by six core principles:
- Transparency
- Trust
- Open-source
- Public Good
- Ease of Use
- Equity

CivicPress is shaped by principles that support democracy, not just efficiency.

---

### Transparency  
Decisions, records, and changes should be visible by default.  
Closed systems create closed cultures. CivicPress is designed to expose the workings of government — not obscure them.

---

### Trust  
Trust must be earned — through clarity, accountability, and reliability.  
CivicPress is built to document what happened, show what’s real, and create systems that citizens can verify — not just believe in.

---

### Open-source  
Civic infrastructure should never be locked away.  
CivicPress is open by design — inspectable, forkable, repairable.  
No license keys. No black boxes. No surprises.

---

### Public Good  
CivicPress exists to serve the public interest.  
It is not optimized for revenue, ad clicks, or shareholder returns.  
Its only measure of success is how well it supports the people who rely on it.

---

### Ease of Use  
If a town clerk can’t use it, it’s not finished.  
If a citizen can’t find it, it’s not public.  
CivicPress must be usable without consultants, tutorials, or advanced degrees — because democracy belongs to everyone, not just experts.

---

### Equity  
Civic tools must work for everyone — regardless of income, geography, or background.  
CivicPress is designed to reduce barriers, not raise them.  
Participation should be a right, not a privilege.

> These are not extras. They are the structure.  
> Without them, CivicPress would be just another app.  
> With them, it becomes something better: **infrastructure for trust**.

---

## 5. A Call to Action

The public sector doesn’t need another vendor.  
It needs allies.  
It needs builders, thinkers, organizers — people who still believe in the quiet strength of public service.

If you’re a developer, a designer, a city clerk, a journalist, a mayor, or just someone who wants to help — there’s a place for you here.

CivicPress is still young.  
But it is growing, and it is open.

You can:
- Contribute code  
- Translate the interface  
- Test modules  
- Document policies  
- Help a town set up its first civic record

You don’t need permission — just purpose.

Our goal is not to replace institutions.  
It’s to support them, strengthen them, and help them reflect the people they serve.

Because democracy is infrastructure.  
And CivicPress is a tool to help it work better — one transparent line at a time.
