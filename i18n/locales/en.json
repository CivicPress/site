      "lede": "Citizens deserve systems they can see, trust, and afford.",
      "body": "Most public systems still lock public information behind PDFs, portals, or proprietary software. The result is the same everywhere: citizens can't see what's happening, civic staff struggle to maintain broken tools, and trust keeps eroding. Every hidden document or delayed update makes the work of government feel distant, fragile, and expensive.",
      "body2": "CivicPress takes the opposite path: open formats, clear links, and records you can audit or improve. By making data inspectable and durable, it restores a foundation of trust between citizens and institutions. A non-profit structure is being developed to preserve public ownership and ensure CivicPress remains truly public infrastructure. It’s not just software; it’s public infrastructure built to last."

    "whyVideo": {
      "title": "Why CivicPress exists",
      "body1": "Modern municipalities rely on digital systems to function — yet most of those systems were never designed for public life. They are expensive, closed, and built around commercial priorities instead of civic ones. Small towns are often left behind, and larger cities become dependent on tools they cannot audit, cannot repair, and cannot trust.",
      "body2": "CivicPress exists to change this pattern.",
      "body3": "It starts from a simple idea: public information should live in public formats, under public control. When the tools that manage records, meetings, and civic processes are open, portable, and understandable, governments become more resilient. Staff gain clarity. Citizens gain trust. And the work of democracy becomes a little more visible — and a lot more durable.",
      "body4": "CivicPress is built to serve that purpose: a shared, open, community-governed infrastructure that any municipality can rely on, no matter its size or budget, and that everyone can inspect, improve, or help build."

    "howItWorks": {
      "title": "How CivicPress works",
      "body1": "CivicPress works like a civic foundation built from simple, open materials. Each record (whether a bylaw, a meeting, or a map) is stored in plain text formats that can be opened by anyone, anywhere. There's no need for special software or licenses, just honesty in the way information is kept.",
      "body2": "Behind the scenes, Markdown and YAML structure each record so they can be versioned with Git. Every change is logged, every contributor is visible, and nothing is lost in translation between departments or years.",
      "body3": "Maps and media give life to the data: you can link files, connect documents, or reference the places they describe. Whether hosted in the cloud or on a town’s local server, CivicPress keeps information consistent and durable.",
      "body4": "By replacing costly licenses with open standards, CivicPress helps public institutions save money while keeping control of their own data. The goal isn't just efficiency, it's trust. By making civic work inspectable, portable, and future-proof, CivicPress turns technology into a public asset instead of an ongoing expense.",
      "example": "When a town council votes on a new zoning bylaw, that decision becomes a Markdown record with a unique ID. The vote is linked to the bylaw text, which references the map showing affected areas, all versioned in Git. A year later, anyone can trace exactly when and why that rule changed."

      "currentBody": "CivicPress v0.1.1 marks the first stable foundation of the platform, enough to publish, link, and visualize civic records openly. It demonstrates that public infrastructure can be built transparently, with modern tools and civic intent. The release focuses on core functionality, Markdown-based records, and the first working demo for municipal use.",
      "foundationTitle": "Toward a Public Foundation",
      "foundationBody": "The next phase isn't just technical, it's organizational. We're preparing a non-profit foundation or cooperative to steward CivicPress in the public interest (formalizing governance, defining contributor rights, and preserving public ownership of the platform). This structure will ensure long-term governance that reflects CivicPress's core values: transparency, openness, and trust.",
      "pilotsBody": "In parallel, we're exploring pilot projects with municipalities interested in testing CivicPress in real contexts. Early conversations are underway with municipalities in Québec exploring pilot implementations. These collaborations will guide priorities, accessibility improvements, and policy integration.",
      "closing": "This is how CivicPress grows, openly, slowly, and with care. Like any public infrastructure, it earns trust through clarity, reliability, and the people who choose to build it together."

Automatic versioning backed by Git keeps a verifiable history, and clear links between documents, meetings, and decisions bring order and transparency to the records that shape daily life."

CivicPress helps municipalities meet their obligations by making documents clear, organized, and accessible - often reducing the need for formal CAI requests in the first place. This strengthens compliance, staff capacity, citizen trust, and a culture of transparency. Less time searching. More time serving the community."

There is no vendor lock-in: your data is always exportable, your stack is transparent, and your civic records belong to your community, not to a supplier."

      "body2": "We’ve all seen what happens when civic systems are handed to closed, expensive vendors: budgets rise, trust falls, and citizens lose control of their own information. Civic software built for profit tends to overpromise, underdeliver, and leave municipalities dependent on outside contracts.",
      "body3": "CivicPress exists to reverse that pattern. It's open-source, inspectable, and built for the public good. Every line of code, every record format, every improvement is meant to be shared, not sold.",
